# Mario Sprite Images

To complete the Super Mario look, you need to add these sprite images in this directory:

1. `mario-small.png` - Small Mario sprite (32x48 pixels)
2. `mario-big.png` - Big Mario sprite (32x64 pixels) 
3. `mario-fire.png` - Fire Mario sprite (32x64 pixels)

You can find these sprites online or create your own pixel art versions.

## Sprite Sheet Format

If you're using sprite sheets, make sure they follow this format:
- Each frame should be 32px wide
- Animation frames should be horizontally aligned
- Include at least 4 frames for walking animation

## Example Source

You can find Mario sprites on sites like:
- The Spriters Resource
- OpenGameArt.org
- Or use your own custom pixel art
